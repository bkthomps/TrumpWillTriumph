 * <br>
 * You must play as Donald Trump to conquer the USA a state at a time by playing various mini-games.&nbsp;Each state has
 * its own mini-game.&nbsp;If the mini-game is won, the state becomes Republican, and thus red.&nbsp;If the mini-game is
 * lost, the state becomes Democrat, and thus blue.&nbsp;Since there are 50 states in the USA, at the end of the game,
 * if 25 or more states become Republican, you, Donald Trump, become president of the United States of America.&nbsp;
 * However, if less than 25 states are won, you lose the race of presidency to Hillary Clinton, your rival.&nbsp;Let it
 * be noted that "Triump" in "Trump Will Triump" was spelled as such on purpose.
