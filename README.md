# TrumpWillTriumph
You are running for president of the United States of America. To become president, you must conquer at least 25 of the
50 states. Each state can be conquered by winning a unique challenge.

## Setup
1. The Java version for this project is Java 8.
2. Make sure you have the JDK or JRE installed. If you do not have either of those installed, you can install the JRE
by going [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) and following the
steps.
3. Download the Assets folder and TrumpWillTriumph.jar to the same location on your computer. You can do this by
downloading the zip in the top right of the GitHub UI and then unzipping it locally on your computer.
4. Afterwards, you can run the application by running the jar file. If this does not work, you can run it using
`java -jar TrumpWillTriumph.jar` in your command line.
